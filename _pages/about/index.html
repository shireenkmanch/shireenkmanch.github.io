<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>Iâ€™m Shireen, a machine learning researcher based in Oxford, UK, and currently a PhD candidate at <a href="https://www.brookes.ac.uk/profiles/student/shireen-kudukkil-manchingal" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Oxford Brookes University</a>. I focus on building robust and trustworthy ML systems: models that arenâ€™t just confident, but aware of <em>what they donâ€™t know</em>. My research lies at the intersection of uncertainty quantification, large-scale models in computer vision and language (LLMs), and real-world AI safety. My PhD is funded by the European Union H2020 Epistemic AI project, in collaboration with KU Leuven, TU Delft, and external partners such as Samsung AI Cambridge, Unuversity of Pennsylvania and University of Manchester.</p> <p>I hold a Masterâ€™s in Information and Network Security from the University of Limerick, Ireland, and a Bachelorâ€™s in Information Technology from University of Calicut, India. Over the past years, Iâ€™ve worked across the globe: from AI in autonomous vehicles in Spain to uncertainty in LLMs in Oxford. I also occasionally teach AI and robotics to both undergrad and postgrad students. You can check out some of my academic work on <a href="https://openreview.net/profile?id=~Shireen_Kudukkil_Manchingal1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">OpenReview</a>.</p> <p>My recent publications at ICLR 2025, AISTATS 2025, and NeurIPS 2024 focus on developing fast, uncertainty-aware models robust to adversarial attacks, and on standardizing evaluation frameworks for reliable machine learning.
